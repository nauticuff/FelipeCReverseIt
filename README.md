Mini Challenge #7 - Reverse It

<<<<<<< HEAD
Peer review: Arely Martinez - The progam works well it did it purpose of reversing a sequence of integers. The data confirmation works for determining its a whole number and at the end when it ask if they play again. You have to enter in yes or no and it did what was needed and asked me again for a proper response. I also like how we incorporated things he learned from CodeAademy onto his work like the /n method. In addition to that the program was very friendly with comments like "My power frightens You" & "My power frightens you" ( some of his personality is protrayed onto his program, nice touch!!).
=======
This code takes in a user's input and displays it. It then 
reverses the order of the input and displays the reverse. 
Top code works ONLY for integers values
and
bottom code works ONLY for string values
